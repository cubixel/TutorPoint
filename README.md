# Software-Engineering-Project JavaFX Learning Branch
Repository for Group 2, MEng Software Engineering Project.

This is a test branch set-up with JavaFX for people to download and play around with. No need to commit anything you've done back to the repository as this is just to speed up the process of getting set up and running with JavaFX.

You can learn some more about JavaFX from this tutorial video.

You can use Scene Builder to create GUIs for JavaFX using a drag-and-drop. This enables the creation of much nicer looking user interfaces. 

Scene Builder can be downloaded here.
